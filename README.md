# Asynchronous Web Scraping Bot

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an asynchronous web scraping bot that fetches data from multiple URLs concurrently. By utilizing asynchronous programming in Python, this bot will efficiently scrape multiple websites, retry failed requests, and process the scraped data without blocking. 

This project is designed to be small-scale to help you practice async in real-world scenarios, but with enough functionality to showcase the clear advantages of asynchronous programming over synchronous solutions.

## Project Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Asynchronous URL Fetching**  
   The bot should fetch multiple URLs concurrently using libraries like `aiohttp` or `httpx`. The async solution will allow scraping large numbers of URLs without waiting for one request to complete before starting another.

2. **Error Handling & Retry Logic**  
   Implement robust error handling (e.g., connection issues, timeouts, invalid responses). Failed requests should be retried using an exponential backoff strategy, ensuring failed URLs have additional chances of succeeding.

3. **HTML Parsing**  
   Parse the content of each webpage using libraries like `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml` to extract specific data points (e.g., titles, prices, or metadata).

4. **Rate Limiting**  
   Ensure the bot doesn’t overwhelm servers by implementing rate limiting (e.g., limiting the number of requests per second to avoid getting blocked).

5. **Logging & Progress Tracking**  
   Implement logging for each request, noting its success or failure. Track progress throughout the scraping process, displaying how many URLs have been processed and remaining.

6. **Concurrency Control**  
   Use concurrency control mechanisms (e.g., `asyncio.Semaphore`) to limit the number of concurrent requests.

7. **Graceful Shutdown**  
   The bot should handle interruptions (e.g., user manually stopping the process) gracefully and allow for a clean shutdown or resume.

## User Inputs

The bot will take input both through a **configuration file** and as a **CLI application** for dynamic flexibility.

### 1. **Configuration File (config.json)**
Users can define their URLs, number of concurrent requests, and retry attempts in a configuration file, making it reusable for batch scraping. This is ideal for users who prefer editing a file without needing to re-enter details each time.

**Example Configuration:**

```json
{
  "urls": [
    "https://example.com/page1",
    "https://example.com/page2"
  ],
  "concurrent_requests": 5,
  "retry_attempts": 3
}
```

### 2. **CLI Application**
The bot will also accept arguments through the CLI for a more dynamic and on-the-fly scraping process. This is useful for smaller jobs where the user doesn’t want to edit a config file.

**Example CLI Command:**
```bash
python scraper.py --urls https://example.com/page1 https://example.com/page2 --concurrent-requests 5
```

### 3. **Combining Both Approaches**
For flexibility, users can specify a configuration file or enter options directly in the CLI. The CLI can be designed to fall back on the config file if arguments aren’t provided.

```bash
python scraper.py --config config.json
```

## Optional Features (Future Enhancements)
- **Data Storage:** Save the scraped data into formats like CSV or JSON.
- **Scraping Delays:** Add randomized delays between requests to mimic human-like behavior.
- **Headless Browsers:** Integrate headless browsers (like `Selenium` or `Playwright`) to scrape dynamic content from websites that require JavaScript to load fully.

---

## Project Boundaries
- **Target URL Count:** Limit the initial version to 50-100 URLs to keep the scope manageable.
- **Data to Scrape:** Focus on extracting 1-2 pieces of information per page.
- **Time Estimate:** This project should be completable in under 10 hours, including testing and debugging.
